I raised my hand to partake in a rendition of: “**I will sing of my redeemer**” as part of the MCSI Youth fellowship. I quickly realised: singing is difficult, especially if you can’t hold a note; even more so without knowing the tune. Add to that multiple harmonies, and it was GG for me. 

When the hymn was offered, I shirked and sat in the pews, rather than embarrassing ~~myself~~ the rest of the crew by ~~attempting~~ singing with them. But just prior to the recital, Anu spoke of its genesis, and that piqued my interest. I don’t think anyone can do full justice to her raconteur-ship but I shall attempt my own version:

### The Genesis of the Hymn: “I will sing of my redeemer”

>Philip Bliss, the author, was a musician and an itinerant gospel singer in America during the mid 1800s. At that time, railway travel was dangerous. Tracks often had to cross multiple ravines, and rivers, over trestle bridges (not made of metal) in order to speedily and efficiently conduct their cargo. While travelling, Bliss would pack his most basic and precious items in a metal suitcase, which was liable to survive falls, and even fires.

> On the 29 December 1876, Bliss and his wife boarded Pacific Express train. I do not know where they were going, but as they were passing Ashtabula, Ohio, a trestle bridge over which the train was crossing, collapsed catastrophically. The ravine below, swallowed the train, while it caught ablaze.

> Bliss survived the fall, and staggered out of the train barely conscious, before passing out. When he regained his senses, Bliss realised that his wife was *still in the carriage* now fully ablaze!

> “I must go back to get my wife!” he cried to his fellow passengers, as they struggled to hold him back.

> “Don’t go!” they pleaded with him, “...you cannot save her because of the fire, and if you attempt it, you will die as well!”

> “Then if she dies,” said the noble Bliss, “I will die with her!”
> 
> The survivors watched in horror as he broke free from his captors and charged headlong into the inferno. Those who attempted to follow Bliss were thwarted by the intense heat, and were driven back

> Bliss entered the carriage, but never came out of it.
> 
> Very little survived the fire, but his suitcase did. Inside was found a hymn he was working on, in its nascent state. The lyrics were complete, but there were no notes nor music to accompany them. 
> 
> These were later added by one of his contemporaries, and that is the tune we know today. We can only guess the tune that Bliss would have added to it himself, if he survived the accident. Perhaps we may find out the next we see him? 

> Bliss is not alive today, but he lives on, through his hymn. 

We sang it both as an incense worship offering, and in his loving memory. 

I do not think I would have valued it as much if I had not heard the story behind it.
