I raised my hand to partake in a rendition of: “**I will sing of my redeemer**” as part of the MCSI Youth fellowship. I quickly realised: singing is difficult – if you can’t hold a note; even more so without knowing the tune. Add to that multiple harmonies, and I was down and out for the count. 

When the hymn was offered, I shirked and sat in the pews, rather than embarrassing ~~myself~~ the rest of the crew by singing with them. But just prior to the recital, Anu spoke of its Genesis, and that piqued my interest. I don’t think anyone can do full justice to her raconteur-ship but I shall attempt my own version:

### The Genesis of the Hymn: “I will sing of my redeemer”

“I will sing of my redeemer” was written by Philip Bliss – a musician and an itinerant gospel singer in America. He lived during the mid 1800s, when railway travel was dangerous. Railway tracks often had to cross multiple ravines, and rivers, over trestle bridges (not made of metal) in order to speedily and efficiently conduct their cargo. While travelling, Bliss would pack his most basic and precious items in a metal suitcase, which was liable to survive falls, and even fires.

> On the 29 December 1876, Bliss and his wife boarded Pacific Express train. I do not know where they were going, but as they were passing Ashtabula, Ohio, a trestle bridge over which the train was crossing, collapsed catastrophically. The ravine below, swallowed the train, while it caught ablaze.

> Bliss survived the fall, and staggered out of the train barely conscious, before passing out. When he regained his senses, Bliss realised that his wife was *still in the carriage* now fully ablaze!

> “I must go back to get my wife!” he cried to his fellow passengers, as they struggled to hold him back.

> “Don’t go!” they pleaded with him, “……….you cannot save her because the fire is too hot, and if you attempt it, you will die as well!”

> “Then if she dies,” said the noble Bliss, “I will die with her!”
> The survivors watched in horror as he broke through his restrainers, ran headlong into the inferno. People attempt to catch him, but were failed by the intense radiation. 

> Sadly, Bliss did not retrieve his wife. The only thing salvaged was his suitcase. And inside, was a hymn he was working on, in its nascent state. The lyrics were complete, but there were no notes. In his memory, a musician added notes to his lyrics. We can only guess the tune that Bliss would have added to it himself. Perhaps we may find out the next we see him? 

> Bliss may not have survived, but he lives on, through his hymn. 

We sang it both as an incense worship offering, and in his loving memory. I do not think I would have valued it as much if I had not heard the story behind it.
