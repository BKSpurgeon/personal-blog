I raised my hand to partake in a rendition of: “**I will sing of my redeemer**” as part of the MCSI Youth fellowship. I quickly realised: singing is difficult – especially if you can’t hold a note; and even more so when you don’t know the tune. Add to that, multiple harmonies, and I was down for the count, down and out. 

I sat in the pews, rather than embarrass the rest of the screw, when the hymn was offered, and prior to the recital, Anu introduced the hymn with a story that I had never heard before. It was a story of it’s genesis and that certainly piqued my interest. I don’t think anyone can do full justice to her raconteur-ship, and this story has probably been romanticized beyond all recognition from the actual historical event, but I should attempt to reproduce my version of it below:

“I will sing of my redeemer” was written by Philip Bliss – a musician and an itinerant gospel singer in America. He lived during the mid 1800s, when railway travel was a little more dangerous than today. Engineering standards might have been questionable back then. Railway tracks often had to cross multiple ravines, and rivers, over trestle bridges in order to speedily and efficiently conduct their cargo.

While travelling, Bliss would pack his most basic and precious items in a metal suitcase. In those days, suitcases were sturdy, and could survive falls, earthquakes and even fires: they were built to last, unlike modern day suitcases.

On the 29 December 1876, Bliss was travelling with his wife on the Pacific Express train. As they were crossing Ashtabula, Ohio, the trestle bridge over which train was crossing collapsed. The train and all its carriages fell into the ravine below, causing it to catch ablaze. 

Somehow, Bliss staggered out of the train alive and conscious, before passing out. When he regained his senses, Bliss immediately realised that his wife was still in the train carriage which was now fully ablaze!

“I must go back to get my wife!” he cried to his fellow passengers, as they struggled to hold him back.

“Don’t go!” they pleaded with him, “……….you cannot save her because the fire is too hot, and if you attempt it, you will die as well!”

“Then if she dies,” said the noble Bliss, “life is not worth living. Let me go!” he cried as he cast them aside, and broke through. 

The survivors watched in horror as he ran straight into the inferno. Nobody could go near the blaze without being forced back by the intense heat.

Unfortunately, both Bliss and his wife perished in the blaze. But his family did recover his suitcase. Inside, they found a sheet of paper which miraculously survived: on it were the lyrics to the hymn Bliss wrote: “I will sing of my redeemer”. Music was added to the lyrics.

Bliss may not have survived, but he lives on, through his hymn. We sang it both as an incense worship offering, and in his loving memory.
