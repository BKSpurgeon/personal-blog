I was speaking to a gentleman, at church -- of all places. He had just started a business, and was hustling for orders, as all good businessmen are wont to do. 

"How are you getting your customers?"

"Advertising"

He spoke of placing an add in a catalogue. They claimed exposure to 18,000 letter boxes. And for those claims, he received a single call: his outlay was fruitless.

What next?

"I tried to do my own marketing," he responded. 1000 notices, in 1000 letterboxes. 

And how did that prove?

"One sale!" he beamed. His smile reached from ear to ear. "My first!"

How are you going to succeed with just one sale?

"I have a plan," he responded, "Facebook Ads! But you have to be very careful on your spending. The money tends to fly away without results if you are not careful."

Sage advice.

I then noted to myself, that money is viewed very differently, if it is your own, and if you are seeking a return on it, than if you were a government department, spending someone else's money, with an indifference as to whether a return is generated. I saw and thought to myself: this is why no government department or bureaucracy can ever suceed in any type of business endeavour. But that doesn't stop our valiant and ever optimistic bureaucrats from engaging in such unprofitable ventures, in the GREAT REPUBLIC that is the SOCIALIST REPUBLIC of the COMMONWEALTH AUSTRALIA. Everyone else who tried before were idiots, WE are the ones who can make this succeed, they cry.

I then proceeded to lament, that after all his hard work: in marketing his wares, and in producing goods/services with much toil, the government should unjustly rape him of his labours by taxing him in every way possible: company tax, paytroll tax, personal income tax, bank taxes, capital gains tax, GST, and all the onerous compliance burdens associated with running a business (GST Business Activity Statements) ad naseaum etc. I suggested to him that it is much easier to become a government bureaucrat, and to "work from home" from 
~~9am - 5pm~~ 10 am - 3 pm on very important projects for the people, and done by the people. 

But he did not lament. His solution was sublime, and novel! 

I laughed and marvelled at his ingenuity. And I thought: what a fool I am: running off to pay my taxes so that the government, in its glorious wisdom, can spend it profitably: (i) on ships that sink when loaded, (ii) and on submarines that cannot sink and are moored because they cannot be manned; (iii) on internet infrastructure that is obsolete and slow, and expensive, (iv) and on overpriced hotel quarantine programs -- whom nobody is in charge of, and whom nobody has any memory of who was in charge, whatsoever.

It was then that I realised that our little republic is somewhat doomed. When honest, God-fearing men, resort to such measures to earn a living: how can this republic survive? 

The risks of business are dangerous enough. With taxes imposed, it is much easier to make a buck for yourself underground, than to voluntarily contribute your labour to be mispent by incompetent and corrupt bureaucracies, engaging in activities they have no business in engaging in. 

The little business that survives against all odds, will no doubt be soon snuffed out with the bi-partisan support of the Australian Labour Party, and the Liberal-National coalition. That is probably the only policy both parties can agree upon. 

This is a government by the bureaucrat, for the bureaucrat.
