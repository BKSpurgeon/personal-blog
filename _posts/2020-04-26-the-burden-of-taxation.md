I was speaking to a gentleman (his identity is protected). He had just started a business, and was hustling for orders, as all good businessmen are wont to do. 

"How are you getting your customers?" I asked.

"Advertise"

The catalogue he went with claimed exposure to 18,000 letter boxes. The result? Not a *single* call. 18,000 letter boxes..........riiiight. The hit-rate seems abysmally low - I'm not saying that the advertiser is a liar, but I am saying that you can get your face ripped off in business if you're not careful. 

"What next?""

"I do marketing," he responded. "1000 notice."

"And how did that prove?""

"One sale!" he beamed. His smile reached from ear to ear. "First sale!"

"Nice. But how are you going to scale?"

"Now I doing Facebook Ads!" and then he added: "You have to really careful on how you spending. Money fly away if not careful."

Sage advice.

I noted to myself, that money is viewed very differently, if it is your own, and if you are seeking a return on it, than if you were a government department, spending someone else's money, with an indifference as to whether a return is generated. 

I saw and thought to myself: this is why no government department or bureaucracy can ever succeed in any type of business endeavour. 

But that doesn't stop our valiant and ever optimistic bureaucrats from attempting it, in the GREAT REPUBLIC that is the SOCIALIST REPUBLIC of the COMMONWEALTH AUSTRALIA. All else who tried before were idiots, our current political leaders and bureaucrats have the wisdom and expertise to be the only ones in all human history to make a success out of it. 

After hearing of his marketing spend, and his loses, I lamented: after all his hard work and toil, the government should unjustly rape him of his labours by taxing him in every way possible: company tax, pay roll tax, personal income tax, (indirect) bank taxes, capital gains tax, GST, and all the onerous compliance burdens associated with running a business (GST Business Activity Statements) ad naseaum etc. I suggested to him that it is much easier to become a government bureaucrat, and to "work from home" from 
~~11 am - 3 pm (lunch and tea breaks included)~~ 9am - 5pm  on very important projects: projects done for the people, and by the people, amen. 

But he did not lament:

"**I taking cash, BABEY!**"

Sublime! A fair-dinkum entrepreneur, and a true-blue Aussie to boot. And what a fool I am in comparison: accepting only bank transfers, so I can pay my taxes like a dutiful citizen, so that the government, in its glorious wisdom, can spend it profitably: 

    (i) on ships that sink when loaded, 

    (ii) and on submarines that cannot sink, 

    (iii) on submarines that take 20 years to get operational, and are then moored because there aren't enough people to man them; 

    (iv) on internet infrastructure that is obsolete and slow, and TWICE the cost as before, 

    (v) and on overpriced hotel quarantine programs -- whom nobody is in charge of, and whom nobody has any memory of who was in charge of the program. 

Were I to continue writing, I would quickly and irredeemably deplete the vast forests of the Amazon.

It was then that I realised that our little paradise is somewhat doomed: when honest, law-abiding, God-fearing foreigners should resort to such measures to earn a living: how can this republic survive with it's wanton expenditures uncurtailed? 

It is a miracle of life and business evolution that any business survives here. But not to worry, those that remain will soon be rendered extinct through a bi-partisan coalition of the Australian Labour Party, and the Liberal-National coalition - it's FINAL SOLUTION: to entirely eradicate the country of any private enterprise that is left. The goal is to make sure that every hard-working Aussie battler has free stuff given to him by the tax payer, or it's off to the gulags for you, son! 

Friedman was right: this is a government **by** the bureaucrat, **for** the bureaucrat. Little do they know - as has been amply demonstrated by my friend - that the tax payer is silently revolting: he's bolted from the stables while the bureaucrat's still sound asleep.
