I was speaking to a gentleman -- at church of all places -- who shall remain namless. He had just started a business, and was hustling for orders. 

I asked him: "What is your business?"

In other words, what are you going to be doing for someone else, so that they  will engage in trade voluntarily with you? He responded accordingly. The marketing was done, but was expensive, and perhaps unscalable.

My next question:

"How are you going to get customers?"

"By advertising"

He had tried hiring a company to do his advertising. They would put his details and services on a brochure and drop them off in various letterboxes. 18,000 of them to be exact. And this availed no results. Not a single call. His outlay was fruitless and his investment lost.

What next?

"I tried to my own marketing," he responded. 1000 notices, in 1000 letterboxes. 

And how did that prove?

"It lead me to one sale" he beamed. "My first sale!"

How then are you going to move forward with just one sale?

"I'be been marketing using Facebook Ads." And then he added very appropriately, "But you have to be very careful how you spend on marketing. The money tends to fly away without results if you are not careful"

I then noted to myself, that money is viewed very differently, if it is your own money, and if you are seeking a return from it, than if you were a government department, spending someone else's money, with indifference as to whether any return is generated, either now or in 10 years. I saw and thought to myself: this is why no government department or bureaucracy can ever suceeding.

I then proceeded to lament, that after all his hard work: in marketing his wares, and in producing goods/services, the government should unjustly rape him of his labours by taxing him in every way possible: company tax, personal income tax, bank taxes, capital gains tax, GST, and all the onerous compliance obligations associated with running a business, added to that: the medicare levy, and other burdensome compliance obligations, and I noted that it is much easier to become a government bureaucrat, and to "work from home" from 
~~9am - 5pm~~ 10 am - 3 pm on important projects for the people. 

His solution was more than adequate, and te most novel of all!

I laughed and marvelled at his ingenuity. And I thought: what a fool I am: running off to pay my taxes so that the government, in its glorious wisdom, can spend it well: on ships that sink, and on submarines that cannot sink, and that are not manned, and on internet infrastructure that is obsolete and slow, and expensive, and on overpriced hotel quarantine programs whom nobody is in charge of, and whom nobody has any memory of whatsoever.

It was then that I realised that our little republic was somewhat doomed. We are being overtaxed and overburdened: so much so that it is far easier to avoid sticking your neck out, and to make a buck for yourself, than to voluntarily contribute your labours to be mispent by a bureaucracy. 

I have no doubt that taxes will continue to rise so that the little productive labours remaining, will be forced underground.
