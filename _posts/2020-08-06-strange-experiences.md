If some incident happens to you, and you see it happen, and you experience it happening: do you ever doubt the authenticity of that said experience? For sure, crazy things do happen. One might even think, "Oh my God! I can't believe this is happening" - because you can't believe it's actually happening, but you would never doubt your experience, would you? 

There have been some instances in my life, which I never questioned **as they actually happened**, but which in retrospect, seemed a little weird, a little strange. In fact, I would look askance at them if they were related to me by a third party; a friend of mine even ventured to question the historicity of it all in the first place:

"Dude, it couldn't have happened!" he said, "you were dreaming -- or you probably had an overly wild imagination."


### What I saw on a flight to somewhere

I'll let you, the dear reader, decide upon whether this actually happened or not.

We were on a flight somewhere - where exactly I cannot remember. I would have been about 5 years old.

For a five year old, it's an exciting experience. I sat right next to the window, and peered through it with with eager delight, out into  into the clear blue: sometimes above clouds and sometimes passing through them! What an experience. I was in awe of it all. 

And then, we saw something a little disturbing: there, as we were flying thousands of feet above the air, at just under the speed of sound, through the window, I saw another plane! Another plane just like us! I thought it was pretty cool. I thought it was tantamount to the experience of sitting on a train in a platform, and seeing another train, slowly creep away, lumbering on to an unknown destination. Sometimes, you can see through the windows and see the passengers on the other train, and they, if they were curious enough, would be able to see you. And maybe, they might even catch your eye. And if you were feeling bold enough, perhaps you might even blow them a kiss. (Actually, don't try that. Well, don't try that if you are a large black male. But if you are of the female sex, then by all means: you can give it a shot. But do not blame me for the consequences which may result. Or maybe you can reward me if the experiment should prove fruitful. The point being is that I could see someone through the window. Small vignettes of people doing what people do on the plane. And what a glorious sight it was!)

It was perhaps 50 metres away - but probably more. Perhaps 100 metres away. It was close enough for me to see the plane clearly, visibly. It held a steady pace, very similar to our own. If we were racing, then we were racing as if we were two snails. What I do know, was that I clearly saw a plane, flying through the middle of the air, while I myself was also on a plane. It was uncanny.

"Mummy, mummy!" I cried, tugging on her sleeve, "...look through the window I can see..."

"That's enough Benny!" she chided me, "please sit still and don't not make a fuss."

"But mummy look!" I pointed through the window, "Look! there's a..."

"-- Would you sit down and shut up!" she snapped.

I resigned myself to my fate. Nobody ever listens. Nobody ever listens to kids. I know what happened, and I know what I saw.

Now, looking back today, I would see this as a gross and dangerously negligent cock up. Planes should never fly in close formation together, especially passenger jet liners: it's too dangerous. The jet stream of one would tear the other to shreds. All would die a terribly and frightening death. The pilots would be deemed grossly negligent, and possibly others too.

The plane interested me momentarily. But the excitement soon vanished, and I drifted off to do something else. And when I looked up again, the plane was gone!

I didn't think about it much. But many years later, I was watching a TV show about the dangerous and destructive nature of jet streams, and was then immediately reminded of what I had seen as a kid, and I thought how lucky I was to have survived that.

And I would have never questioned that experience, had a friend of mine said I had imagined the whole thing.

The question is: did it happen, or was it my imagination?

I will insist it did happen.
