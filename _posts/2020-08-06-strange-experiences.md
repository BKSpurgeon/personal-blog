If some incident happens to you, and you see it happen, and you experience it happening: do you ever doubt the authenticity of that said experience? For sure, crazy things do happen, and one might think, "Oh my God! I can't believe this is happening" - because you can't believe it's actually happening, but you would never doubt your experience, would you? 

There have been some instances in my life, which I never questioned **as they actually happened**, but which in retrospect, seemed a little weird, a little strange. They are instances which I would look askance at, if they were related to me by a third party; a friend of mine even ventured to question the historicity of it all in the first place.

"Dude, it couldn't have happened!" he said, "you were dreaming -- or you probably had an overly wild imagination."

All viable possibilities. All are instances which happen to other people, notable and reasonable explanations for the seemingly implausible. But all unsatisfactory to my own mind, and my own memory. Sure, other people may confuse events, or conflate them, or may even think them imagined: but not I. My memory is perfect! My lived experience is an undeniable truth, set in stone and interpreted perfectly and "objectively" by me. My memory is preserved like film is preserved, and can immediately be replayed with perfect fidelty; it is an indelible truth that cannot be questioned. I digress: I know what I saw, and what I experienced: how can anyone say it didn't happen, when I saw it happen?

And I remember my earnest and plaintive cries to my parents -- to notice what I saw, when I called attention to it -- to go unnoticed and unheeded -- to be dismissed away with the wave of a hand, as if I was a common house fly: nothing but an annoying and trifling disturbance.

### What I saw on a flight to somewhere

I'll let you, the dear reader, decide upon whether this actually happened or not.

We were on a flight somewhere - where exactly I cannot remember. Probably to Cochin, but on thinking about it now: likely to Delhi. Either on the way there or returning for it. When I was about 5 years old, we took a trip to Delhi. I remember the heat and the exhaustion of the journey: constantly getting on, and off a bus - the busy flitting to and from different attractions, and always in a huff to get back to the bus in time. Water was a scarcity, and I was often thirsty. Yes, we were likely on a trip to Delhi.

So the plane takes off, and I looked through the window, with eager delight, staring out into the clear blue: sometimes above clouds and sometimes passing through them! What an experience. I was in awe of it all. Remember, I was about 5 years old.

And then, we saw something a little disturbing, if you would have related this same incident to me, as an adult. I would have thought it dangerous. I would have thought it crazy, and unlikely, and I would have thought that a few people had gloriously cocked up -- but not impossible in the grand scheme of things, and perhaps even unsurprising.

There, as we were on the flight to Delhi, through the window: I saw another plane! Another plane just like us. I thought it was pretty cool. I thought it was tantamount to the experience of sitting on a train in a platform, and seeing another train, slowly creep away: as it slowly lurches and lumbers on to its unknown destination. Sometimes, you can see through the windows and see the passengers on the other train - not some times, but every time: you can see them, and they, if they were curious enough, they can see you. And maybe, they might even catch your eye. And if you were feeling bold enough, perhaps you might even blow them a kiss. (Actually, don't try that. Well, don't try that if you are a large black male. But if you are petite and small female, then by all means: you can give it a shot. But do not blame me for the consequences which may result. Or actually maybe you can reward me for my advice should the experiment prove fruitful. The point being is that I could see someone through the window. And what a glorious sight it was!)


I saw a plane, perhaps 50 metres away - but probably more. Perhaps 100 metres away. It was close enough for me to see the plane clearly, visible, edging forward. Perhaps even beating our plane if we were in a race. Creeping forward as a turtle might, while both planes were hurtling through the air at a break neck speed. And perhaps, I could even see a person through the window, perhaps even reading the paper - although that could be my imagination. What I do know, was that I clearly saw a plane, flying through the middle of the air, while I myself was also on a plane. It was uncanny.

"Mummy, mummy!" I cried, as a tugged on her sleeve, "...look through the window I can see..."

"That's enough Benny!" she chided me, "please sit still and not make a disturbance"

"But mummy look!" I pointed through the window, "Look! I see a..."

"Would you sit down and shut up!" she snapped.

I resigned myself to my fate. Nobody ever listens. Nobody ever listens to kids. I know what happened, and I know what I saw.

Now, looking back today, I would see this as a gross and dangerously negligent cock up. Planes should never fly in close formation together, especially jet passenger liners. Should one plane even come even remotely close to another, the said air turbulence caused by these planes would be enough to rip the other to shreds. That alone would be enough to send us all tumbling to our fiery death. Both pilots would be deemed negligent, as well as the air traffic control towers.

The plane interested me momentarily. I drifted off to some other activity. And when I looked through the window again, perhaps in 5-10 minutes: the plane was gone!

I didn't think about it much. I was only a kid. But when I saw the destructive force of jet turbines, and how the turbulence caused by one is so dangerous that when taking off, planes have to wait 3 minutes for the air to settle, I immediately remembered the Delhi incident. And I thought about how irresponsible those pilots were. 

I remembered seeing a plane as I myself was flying through the air. And I would have never questioned it, had a friend of mine said I had imagined the whole thing.

The question is: did it happen, or was it my imagination.

And I will insist it did happen. My memory is perfect.
